### Abstract

**Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction** (HFpEF) is driven by co-morbidities. While specific treatments to enable recovery of HFpEF are lacking, recent clinical trials indicate beneficial effects of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists. Here we treated mice with aldosterone-salt to incude a cardiorenal HFpEF-like phenotype and studied progression and regression of the disease at single cell resolution. We found a distinct fibroblast subtype induced that shows partial overlap with fibroblasts found in cardiometabolic HFpEF but is different from the myofibroblast phenotype observed in heart failure with reduced EF. Notably, after aldosterone withdrawal the HFpEF-like phenotype fully recovered. The course of disease progression and regression was linked to the expression of MR target genes and basement membrane collagen subtypes in fibroblasts. MR deletion from fibroblasts prevented cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction, confirming its pivotal function. 

In summary, our study reveals overlapping and distinct features of cardiorenal and cardiometabolic HFpEF that are involved in disease progression and recovery and may underly the beneficial effect of MR antagonists in HFpEF.

### Methodology

Adult male and female **C57BL/6N wildtype mice** were treated with aldosterone plus salt (**ALDO**, 500 µg/kg/day from osmotic minipumps, 1% NaCl in drinking water, *n* = 10) and compared to untreated controls (**CTRL**, *n* = 10). A recovery group (**REC**, *n* = 10) was analyzed after 4–24 weeks post-ALDO withdrawal.

After two weeks of ALDO treatment, **echocardiography** showed **diastolic dysfunction** (MV E/E′: ALDO 37.7 ± 0.8 vs. CTRL 29.9 ± 0.5; *P*<0.001), **left atrial enlargement** (LA area systole: ALDO 4.6 ± 0.1 mm² vs. CTRL 3.7 ± 0.1 mm²; *P*<0.001), and **LV hypertrophy** (posterior wall thickness: ALDO 0.78 ± 0.01 mm vs. CTRL 0.60 ± 0.01 mm; *P*<0.001). These changes fully reversed after ALDO withdrawal, with structural and functional normalization by 8–12 weeks.

Histological analysis showed a **15.4% increase in normalized heart weight** and a **30.7% increase in cardiomyocyte size** after ALDO, along with increased **interstitial and perivascular fibrosis**, all of which resolved during recovery.

### Cellular and Molecular Analysis

To investigate cell type-specific changes, we performed **single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq)** on left ventricular tissue from CTRL, ALDO, and REC hearts (*n* = 4/group, 50% females). Unbiased clustering recovered all major cardiac cell types. **Cardiomyocytes (CMs)**, **fibroblasts (FBs)**, and **capillary endothelial cells (EC-cap)** showed the strongest transcriptional responses to ALDO.

Upregulated genes included *Nppa*, *Nppb*, *Postn*, and MR target genes (*Zbtb16*, *Per1*, *Hlf*, *Dbp*). These genes were downregulated again in REC, mirroring reversal of the HFpEF-like phenotype.

### Cell-Cell Communication

**CellChat** analysis revealed increased intercellular signaling in ALDO, especially from FBs (notably the ALDO-enriched subcluster **FB_0**) to other cell types via **collagen**, **laminin**, and **periostin** pathways. These signals were attenuated in REC.

Comparison with other models showed that the **ALDO-induced fibroblast phenotype** shares features with **cardiometabolic HFpEF (HFD/L-NAME)**, but differs from the **myofibroblast-rich HFrEF** models (e.g., MI, AngII), where *Acta2* and *Col1a1* are more highly expressed.

### Reversibility and Fibroblast MR Deletion

Expression of MR target genes reversed in most cell types during recovery. Despite near-complete structural recovery, CMs retained elevated stress markers (*Nppb*, *Serpine1*), and FBs showed altered ECM gene expression (*Col3a1*, *Col6a6*, *Col15a1*).

Mice with **fibroblast-specific MR deletion** (**MRTcf21Cre**) did not develop diastolic dysfunction, hypertrophy, or fibrosis upon ALDO treatment, confirming the essential role of **FB MR signaling** in HFpEF development.

### Gene Module Analysis

We performed **hdWGCNA** to identify gene co-expression modules in FBs. Eight modules were identified:

- **FB-M1** and **FB-M4** were associated with ALDO-induced remodeling.
- **FB-M3** and **FB-M7** were enriched in REC and linked to **matrix remodeling**, **angiogenesis**, and **wound healing**.
  
FB-M1 overlapped with **FB_0**, while REC modules were more evenly distributed, reflecting broad transcriptional reprogramming during recovery. CellChat confirmed reduced **fibroblast–endothelial** signaling in REC, including pathways like **TGFβ**, **FGF**, and **semaphorins**.

### Conclusion

Aldosterone/salt treatment induces a reversible HFpEF-like phenotype in mice driven by fibroblast-specific MR signaling and resolved through coordinated transcriptional and intercellular remodeling.
